Hypotheses on Limitations:

Simplification through Averages: While averages provide an overview, they may oversimplify the diversity in the listener's taste, potentially overlooking extreme preferences or weighted significance of certain songs.

Snapshot in Time: The data offers a snapshot of the listener's preferences at a specific time, which might not fully capture the dynamic nature of their evolving musical tastes.

Improvement Proposals:

Weighted Averages: To better capture the listener's preferences, consider incorporating weighted averages, giving more significance to songs that hold greater emotional importance or impact.

Temporal Analysis: Explore changes in the audio aura over time by analyzing trends in musical preferences. This could provide insights into the evolution of the listener's moods and preferences.

Incorporate More Features: Expand the analysis by including additional musical features such as tempo, acousticness, and instrumentalness. This broader set of features can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the listener's audio aura.

In conclusion, while the provided averages offer valuable insights into the listener's audio aura, there is room for refinement. By implementing weighted averages, temporal analysis, and incorporating a more extensive set of features, we can create a more accurate and nuanced representation of the listener's musical preferences and moods.
